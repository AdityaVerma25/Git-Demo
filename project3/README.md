# Poem
The dawn tiptoes
Like a maiden dark,
Collecting the sea-shells
On the morning
Deserted beach,
Watched by the swaying palms,
The breaking waves singing a song
For the shy maiden
From the nearby fishermenâ€™s village,
A flower garland in her black hair,
Kohl-lined eyes darting here-n-there,
Like a frightened rabbit crossing a road,
The dawn breaks light and crimson,
Over the silent seascape,
And gentle wakes up the orphan
Cradling a puppy in their home
In the hulk of a boat moored
On the quiet Kerala beach.
